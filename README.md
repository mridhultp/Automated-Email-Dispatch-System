Security Notes

   •	Avoided uploading real Excel data that contained company mail_id and credentials.
   
   •	Do not share or commit your App Password
   
   •	Better use desktop version of git and use gitignoreI to exclude sensitive or unnecessary files. I have not used desktop version of GitHub due to system limitation.

________________________________________
Future Improvements

   •	HTML formatted email body
   
   •	Resume failed email attempts
   
   •	Email preview mode before sending
   
   •	GUI support with Tkinter or Streamlit
